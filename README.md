# wirebot for UNIX

wirebot is a command line client for the Wired 2.0 + 2.5 protocol.

This is the former CLI client "wire" (https://github.com/nark/wire) which has now been extended with bot functions by me. It is controlled via bash. See the file "wirebot.sh" (which must be located in the ~/.wirebot folder) for details.

Building wirebot
</h2>
</summary>

Installing wirebot from sources will be done using the Autotools standard (configure, make, make install).

##### 1. Get wirebot sources via Terminal:

	git clone https://github.com/ProfDrLuigi/wirebot

Then move to the `wirebot` directory:

	cd wirebot/

Initialize and update submodules repositories:

	git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
	libwired/bootstrap

Then check that the `libwired` directory was not empty and `configure` file exists.

##### 3. Run the configuration script:

During the configuration, scripts will check that your environment fills the requirements described at the top of this document. You will be warned if any of the required component is missing on your operating system.

To start configuration for Intel/AMD, use the following command:

	./configure

To start configuration for arm64, use the following command:

	./configure --build=aarch64 --host=aarch64

wirebot is designed to be installed into `/usr/local/bin` by default. To change this, run:

	./configure --prefix=/path	

If you installed OpenSSL in a non-standard path, use the following command example as reference:

	env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib ./configure

Use `./configure --help` in order to display more options.

This will require write permissions to `/usr/local/bin`, or whatever directory you set as the prefix above. Depending of your OS setup, you may require to use `sudo`.

##### 4. Compile and install Binary
	make
	sudo make install
	mkdir ~/.wirebot
	cp wirebot.sh rss.sh tarnkappe.py config update_* ~/.wirebot
	chmod +x ~/.wirebot/wirebot.sh

Don't forget to put your credentials into ~/.wirebot/config before you start the bot the first time.

#### Copy wirebotctl beside the wirebot binary

In case of default path it looks like this:

	chmod +x wirebotctl
	cp wirebotctl /usr/local/bin/.

You can inject any Text from any script to the session this way:
	
	screen -S wirebot -p "wirebot" -X stuff "Hello world!"^M

To enter the running screen session simply type:
	
	/usr/local/bin/./wirebotctl screen
	
To leave the session (not closing!) type:

	ctrl + a and than d

##### 1. Configuration

	~/.wirebot/config
	
Example configuration:

	charset UTF-8

### Troubleshootings

This implementation of the Wired 2.0/2.5 protocol is not compliant with the version of the protocol distributed by Zanka Software, for several deep technical reasons.
